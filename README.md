# Obj-GAN
Obj-GAN - Official PyTorch Implementation

Pytorch implementation for reproducing Obj-GAN results in the paper [Object-driven Text-to-Image Synthesis via Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10740.pdf) by Wenbo Li*, Pengchuan Zhang*, Lei Zhang, Qiuyuan Huang, Xiaodong He, Siwei Lyu, Jianfeng Gao. (This work was performed when Wenbo was an intern with Microsoft Research).
